# Old folders icons for Ubuntu 20.04

This is a GNOME icon theme that repeats Ubuntu 20.04 in its entirety, but its main feature is that it changes folder icons to old orange ones. It's all!

## Installation

1. Download archive from Github [release](https://github.com/ BulbaInc/old-pretty-forlders-icons-ubuntu/releases) or clone repository

```

3. If you don't have gnome-tweak-tool installed than:
